## ⚔️ What is Voxies?

Voxies is a free-to-play tactical RPG game built on the Polygon blockchain. Players command squads of voxel-style NFT characters in turn-based battles across PvE and PvP modes. Each Voxie hero comes with distinct classes, elements, and gear slots — and players can earn VOXEL tokens by winning matches, crafting equipment, and competing in ranked arenas.

Whether you're forming balanced squads or crafting legendary items, Voxies blends pixel charm with deep RPG strategy.
